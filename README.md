# LangChain Project with Poetry Environment

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) for building applications that leverage LLMs (Large Language Models). The environment and dependencies are managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), ensuring a clean and reproducible development setup.

## Features

- Efficient management of dependencies with Poetry.
- Integration with LangChain for LLM-powered workflows.
- Extendable architecture to incorporate additional tools and models.
  
## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later installed on your system.
- Poetry installed. If not, install it using:
  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-project.git
   cd langchain-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Use Poetry to install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Activate the Poetry Shell**
   Start the Poetry environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```


### Running the Application

After setting up the environment, you can run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Key Dependencies

- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM-powered applications.
- **Chroma**: Vector store for managing embeddings.
- **HuggingFace Transformers**: For fine-tuning and integrating custom models.
- **OpenAI API**: For accessing GPT models.

## Adding New Dependencies

To add a new dependency, use:
```bash
poetry add package_name
```

For development dependencies, use:
```bash
poetry add --dev package_name
```
